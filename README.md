evolve.py: Evolution code, specific to neural networks<br/>
neuralnets.py: Basic neural network code in python, only to keep it raw. Feel free to to substitute in with any of the available modules (keras etc).<br/>
main.py: main driver class<br/>

vanilla_nn_driver.py: Ignore, untill you just want to explore neuralnets code.<br/>

For a bit more decent nn implementation check: https://github.com/AbhishekAshokDubey/NeuralNetworkPython <br/>
For understanding the backpropagation implementation, check: https://github.com/AbhishekAshokDubey/RL/tree/master/ping-pong <br/>
