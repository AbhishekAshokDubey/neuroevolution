**evolve.py**: Evolution code, specific to neural networks<br/>
**neuralnets.py**: Basic neural network code in python, only to keep it raw. Feel free to to substitute in with any of the available modules (keras etc).<br/>
**main.py**: main driver class<br/>
vanilla_nn_driver.py: Ignore, untill you just want to explore neuralnets code.<br/>

For a bit more decent nn implementation check: https://github.com/AbhishekAshokDubey/NeuralNetworkPython/blob/master/NeuralNets.py <br/>
For understanding the backpropagation implementation, check: https://github.com/AbhishekAshokDubey/RL/blob/master/ping-pong/README.md <br/>
